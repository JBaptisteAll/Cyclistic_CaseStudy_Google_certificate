# Cyclistic_CaseStudy

# Introduction
Welcome to the Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study! This project was undertaken as part of the requirements for the Google Analytics Certificate, where I aimed to explore the usage patterns of casual riders versus annual members within the Cyclistic bike-share program.

# Background
The data for this analysis is from The Google Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera. This data includes details on start and end times of trips, type of bike used (classic or electric), membership type (casual rider or annual member). 

## The questions I wanted to answer through my analysis

1. What are the most common differences between Casual and Annual riders?
2. What types of usage do annual and casual riders have?
3. What is the total number of uses per type?
4. What are the busiest times of the day?
5. What are the busiest times of the year?
6. What are the most frequent uses of the bike(Electric Vs Classic)?

# Tools I used
In this project, I utilized a variety of tools to conduct my analysis:

- **Excel**: Enabled me to interact with the data, and answer my key questions.
- **PowerPoint**: to effectively present my findings, incorporating key insights, visualizations, and recommendations.

|AVG Duration|          |
|------------|---------:|
| Member     | 12:26 Min|
| Casual     | 26:24 Min|
| Total      | 17:11 Min|

| Days       |     Member  |Casual    |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Monday     |     482 039 | 229 967  |
| Tuesday    |     561 901 | 239 996  |
| Wednesday  |     571 422 | 242 643  |
| Thursday   |     573 446 | 263 283  |
| Friday     |     516 716 | 302 252  |
| Saturday   |     459 553 | 398 624  |
| Sunday     |     399 435 | 329 008  |

# What I learned
Throughout this project, I honed several key Excel techniques and skills:

- **Complex Excel Construction**: Learning to build advanced Excel formula that combine multiple sheets.

- **Data Calculation**: Utilized formulas like **`SUMIFS`**, **`COUNTIFS`** and **`AVERAGEIFS`** to summarize data effectively.

- **Analytical Thinking**: Developed the ability to translate real-world questions into actionable and insightful answers.

### **Insights**

From the analysis, several general insights emerged:

•	**Seasonal Trends**: Usage peaks during summer months, with a noticeable decline in winter.

•	**Daily and Hourly Trends**: Casual riders predominantly use bikes on weekends, while annual members show higher usage during weekdays. Peak usage hours for both groups are between 3 PM and 6 PM.

•	**Trip Duration**: Casual riders tend to have longer trip durations compared to annual members, with significant variation between electric and classic bikes.

•	**Trends in trip**: The analysis revealed that casual riders are more likely to use Cyclistic services for leisure during weekends, while annual members primarily use bikes for commuting during weekdays.

# Conclusions
This project significantly improved my analytical skills and provided valuable insights into the cycle rental business. The findings from the analysis offer a strategic guide for optimizing operations and enhancing customer satisfaction. By focusing on key metrics such as peak usage times, rider types, and trip durations, cycle rental businesses can better align their services with customer demand. This exploration underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making and continuous adaptation to evolving customer needs in the competitive rental market.
